        <p> <b>Data Types:</b> The pie charts are positioned on an x-y plane, so their data type is position. The pie charts themselves show categorical attributes in their color so their data type is attribute (specifically categorical). The fraction of the pie being taken up by each category is a quantitative data type.  But also the size of the pie chart shows a quantitative attribute data type. As a whole the pie charts are item data types. <br>
        <b>Marks:</b> The marks of this visualization are both points and Areas/Volumes. The pie charts are used as points on the x-y plane but within each pie chart, area is used to convey the data. These are items and not links <br>
        <b>Channels:</b> The channels being used here are both horizontal and vertical postion, color, area size, and possibly tilt.

        <p> <b>Data Types:</b> The link data type is being used to show a relationship between points. The grid data type is also being used to show ranking over the years. Each individual point is also an item data type. The colors of the items and links are categorical attributes as well as the letters A through E. The numbers on the left hand side and the years at the top are ordered attributes.  <br>
        <b>Marks:</b> The marks here are connection links.  <br>
        <b>Channels:</b>  The channels being used here are color, both horizontal and vertical position and tilt.

        <img class = "image" src="img/mind_map.png" alt="Mind Map"> 
        <p> <b>Data Types:</b> The link data type is being used to show a relationship between points. Color is a categorical attribute here to show each type of bubble. Each point is an item data type. Position is also a data type that is used. <br>
        <b>Marks:</b> The marks here are connection links. <br>
        <b>Channels:</b> The channels being used here are horizontal position and color.

        <img class = "image" src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png" alt="Stacked Bar Chart"> 
        <p> <b>Data Types:</b> Color is being used here as a categorical attribute. Each colored chunk of a bar is an item as well as each of the four bars as a whole. Position is a data type here. Each letter A through D is a categorical attribute. The measurements on the left hand side are quantitative attributes. <br>
        <b>Marks:</b> The marks here are areas which are items and not links. <br>
        <b>Channels:</b> The channels being used here are color, horizontal position and size (specifically length and area).
